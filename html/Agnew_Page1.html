	A BRIEF HISTORY OF GLOBAL PANDEMICS & THE CORONAVIRUS</font
	</p>
	<BR><BR>
	
	<div>
	<p> Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in animals, primarily
	mammals and birds. When humans come in contact with this group of viruses,
	respiratory tract infections are extremely common, and these infections can
	range from very mild sickness to fatality. Other illnesses can be brought on by
	Coronaviruses like the common cold, as well as flu-like symptoms. An key part 
	of understanding the current pandemic is to study global health crises that took 
	place throughout history. <p>

	<p> "The history of human coronaviruses began in 1965 when Tyrrell and Bynoe1 
	found that they could passage a virus named B814. It was found in human embryonic
	 tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of an adult
	  with a common cold." -Kahn, Jeffrey S. MD, PhD & McIntosh, Kenneth MD <p>
