	<p> Cholera is classified as a bacterial infection of the small intestine. It is 
	caused by certain strains of "Vibrio cholerae" and can be potentially fatal
	within hours of exposure. The most common symptom of Cholera is diarrhea, followed
	by muscle cramps and vomiting. The first Cholera outbreak was during 1817-1824, but
	there were many additional outbreaks in years to come. In 1973, the Cholera Outbreak 
	was the most exacerbated 
	 in parts of Africa, South Asia, and Africa.
	 Cholera is similar to COVID19 as hand washing is a key component in stopping the 
	 spread of the virus, as well as access to safe
	drinking water and having cleanly food.
