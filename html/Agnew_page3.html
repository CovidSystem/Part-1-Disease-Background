	<p> The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic was an illness caused
	by the H1N1 influenza A virus. The virus lasted for a little over a year and 
	infected about 500 million people, which was approximately 1/3 of the world's 
	population during this time. There were anywhere from 17 to 50 million deaths, 
	possibly as high as 100 million. This pandemic was extremely devastating and still
	is known as one of the deadliest pandemics to this day.
